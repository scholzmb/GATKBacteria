Materials and Methods
Sequence Analysis 
Sequence data was submitted to QA/QC using FastQC [version] (REF), and Trimmomatic [version] (REF) with appropriate trimming and adapter options.  Trimmed reads were aligned to the reference genome (Link to Reference genome at NCBI here) using BWA mem (REF).  Subsequent steps to identify variants were taken using the PicardTools [Version] and GATK [Version] (REF) with the GATK recommended practices (website links).  Identified SNPs were annotated using TRAMS [version] (REF).  A complete set of all commands utilized for this analysis can be downloaded from git: (Link).
