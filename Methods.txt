Materials and Methods
Sequence Analysis 
Sequence data was submitted to QA/QC using FastQC V-0.11.4 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), and Trimmomatic V.0.33 (Bolger, et al. 2014) using LEADING:3 and TRAILING:3 and appropriate adapter options.  Trimmed reads were aligned to the reference genome (Link to Reference genome at NCBI here) using BWA mem (Li and Durbin, 2009).  Subsequent steps to identify variants were taken using the PicardTools V.1.130 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) and GATK Version-3.4.46 (McKenna et al., 2010) with the GATK recommended practices (DePristo et al., 2011; Van der Auwera et al., 2013)  Identified SNPs were annotated using TRAMS (Reumerman, et al., 2013).  A complete set of all commands utilized for this analysis can be downloaded from git: (Link).
